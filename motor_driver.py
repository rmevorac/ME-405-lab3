class MotorDriver:
    '''!
    @brief      This class is used to control a motor using the Pyboard and its pins.
    @details    The class initializes the pins for the enable, input 1, and input 2 pins of the motor.
                It also initializes a timer for PWM control of the motor. The class provides a function
                to set the duty cycle of the PWM signal applied to the motor to control its speed.

        @brief      Constructor method for MotorDriver class
        @details    The constructor method initializes a MotorDriver object with the given enable pin (en_pin), 
                    input 1 pin (in1pin), input 2 pin (in2pin), and timer number (timer_num). It sets the specified 
                    pins as outputs, creates a timer using the given timer number, and initializes the pin_en, 
                    ch1, and ch2 attributes.

        @brief      This method sets the duty cycle of the PWM signal that drives the motor.
        @details    The duty cycle is set based on the level parameter. If the level is negative, the duty cycle of
                    the PWM signal to channel 1 of the motor is set to -1 times the level, and the duty cycle of the
                    PWM signal to channel 2 of the motor is set to 0. If the level is positive, the duty cycle of the
                    PWM signal to channel 1 of the motor is set to 0, and the duty cycle of the PWM signal to channel
                    2 of the motor is set to the level. If the level is 0, the duty cycle of both channels is set to 0.
        @param      self The object itself
        @param      level The duty cycle of the PWM signal as a percentage (-100 to 100).
